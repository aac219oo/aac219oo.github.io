Before entering the technology field, my career started uniquely. I served in the military for four years, mainly responsible for logistics and supply work. This experience cultivated my emphasis on discipline, planning, and execution efficiency. After retiring, I went to South Seattle College in the United States for one year of further study, and then returned to Taiwan due to family reasons.<br><br>🚀 Career Transition and Skill Development<br>After returning to Taiwan, with a strong interest in programming, I decided to turn to software development. I first learned frontend basic technologies such as HTML and CSS through the vocational training center system and successfully obtained the Level C technician for frontend web design. After completing the training, knowing that the software industry is developing rapidly, I continued to invest time in self-learning JavaScript to meet the needs of the modern workplace. During my time as a frontend engineer at Mass Technology and Zhe Yu Technology, I participated in various projects and proficiently mastered the development and application of multiple mainstream frameworks, including Angular, Vue, and React. This experience not only accumulated solid technical strength but also gave me a comprehensive perspective from project planning to actual program development.<br><br>🌟 Cross-domain Experience<br>Early service industry experience (catering, retail) and military logistics background gave me excellent communication and coordination skills, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail. These qualities became my key advantages for efficient cooperation with the team when serving as a project manager and cross-departmental cooperation. My career transition proves that I have strong motivation to learn, the ability to adapt to rapid changes, and can transform past seemingly unrelated experiences into professional value in the software development field.",
